# ConnectFour-RL-DQN-MCTS
Integrating Monte Carlo Tree Search with DQN for Connect Four
Project Overview
Building upon our previous work with ConnectFour-RL-DQN, this project aims to enhance our reinforcement learning agent's performance by incorporating Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). By combining the pattern recognition capabilities of our trained DQN models with the strategic depth of MCTS, we seek to create a more robust and sophisticated game-playing agent.
Technical Background
Previous Work (ConnectFour-RL-DQN)
In our previous project, we implemented and trained Deep Q-Network agents using various architectural configurations:

- Basic CNN architecture with 2D convolutions
- Residual blocks for deeper feature extraction
- Attention mechanisms for position-aware move selection

These models demonstrated varying degrees of success in learning Connect Four strategies, with the residual network architecture showing particularly promising results in terms of win rate and learning stability.
Proposed Enhancement: MCTS Integration
Monte Carlo Tree Search will be integrated with our existing DQN framework through the following mechanisms:

Neural Network Guided Tree Search

Using the trained DQN as a policy network to guide MCTS node expansion
Leveraging the Q-values from our network to initialize new nodes
Implementing a hybrid action selection mechanism that combines MCTS statistics with DQN predictions


Dynamic Tree Reuse

Maintaining and updating the search tree across multiple moves
Implementing pruning strategies to manage memory usage
Developing heuristics for tree node retention and disposal


Training Pipeline

Fine-tuning the DQN weights using MCTS-enhanced gameplay
Implementing a self-play mechanism that uses MCTS during training
Collecting and analyzing game statistics to measure improvement
